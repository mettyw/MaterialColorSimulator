# Future Ideas
* also generate colorMap.js from m3.xml
* change real CSS class (via CSSOM?) instead of all fill properties in SVG - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/45210949 
* SVG enrichment
  * svg item (e.g. rect) contains CSS class for elevation / tint
  * Javascript enriches the SVG 
    * (e.g. with overlayed rect with tint color / elevation shadow via mixing CSS into it?)
    * needs more complex logic to map component click to desired color swatch on click
* support click / ripple color
* support additional syling like corner treatment (possible via CSS?)
* day and night theme - https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/color-schemes-with-css-variables-and-javascript--cms-36989
